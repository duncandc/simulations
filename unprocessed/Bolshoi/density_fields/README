These files were downloaded from Cosmosim.org

Each file was the result of an SQL query on the cosmosim server.
For example, the density field for redshift 0 was the result of the following query: 

SELECT snapnum, ix, iy, iz, dens FROM Bolshoi.Dens256 where snapnum=416

The file naming scheme is densxxx_yyy.csv, 
where xxx is the grid spacing, and yyy is the snapshot number.
