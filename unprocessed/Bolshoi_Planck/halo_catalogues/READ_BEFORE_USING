Bolshoi-Planck Catalogs Public Release, version 1.55.  (12/18/2015).

Each "hlist" file is a catalog which contains all the halos and subhalos at a
single simulation output, in ASCII format.

The numbers in the filename (e.g., hlist_0.XYZ) refer to the scale factor of the
output.  Each halo record is a single line, which has many space-separated columns.
The details of what is in each column is contained in the first few lines of each
catalog, and includes halo positions, velocities, masses, and many other useful
properties.  Some columns contain indices (e.g., depthFirstIndex) which are only
relevant for merger trees---these are kept only for consistency with the merger
tree format.

Further details of the catalog format are available in the appendix of this paper, which also
contains scaling relations and fitting functions for many halo properties:
